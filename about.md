### About us
My group works at the intersection of clinical research, biomedical informatics and molecular biology to understand how breastfeeding impacts infant health outcomes. If you are interested in working in my lab, please send me an email with your interests.

### Research Projects
Projects in the lab are thematically organized below.   

1) Mining Breastfeeding Outcomes from Electronic Health Records. The goal of this project is to use clinical notes and natural language processing (NLP) to extract structured breastfeeding data from electronic health records. The long-term focus of this project is to estimate geospatial variation in breastfeeding outcomes and the social determinants of health that impact breastfeeding outcomes. The results of this project has potential to characterize the social determinants of health that can be targeted for future precision public health interventions. 

2) Human Milk Metabolomics and Microbe-Host Interactions. The goal of this NIH-funded project is to characterize the functional relationships between breastfeeding, the gut microbiome, and pediatric obesity. Breifly, the Breastfeeding and EArly Child Health (BEACH) study is focused on leveraging un-targeted metabolomics to identify human milk compounds that stabilize a healthy infant microbiome and are associated with infant growth during a critical window of development. The translational impact of this project is to develop low-cost dietary interventions for pregnant overweight/obese mothers that target microbial-derived compounds in human milk with therapeutic potential to attenuate the transmission of obesity risk from mother to child. 

3) Maternal Perspectives on Clinical Research Participation. The goal of this study is to develop data-driven strategies for recruitment and retention of breastfeeding mothers into longitudinal clinical microbiome studies. The results of this study will provide practical insights devoted to effective recruitment and retention of pregnant and breastfeeding women for longitudinal microbiome studies.
