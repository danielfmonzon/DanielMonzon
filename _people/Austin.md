Major: Nutritional Sciences
Minor: Health Education
Junior
Hi, my name is Austen Hentschel, I am from Jacksonville, FL. I have ambitions to become a physican when I enter the medical field.
In the future when I am a physician I hope to work closely with womenâ€™s health and family medicine. I also hope to have the opportunity
to open an integrative clinic of my own. My research interests include maternal-fetal health and
the role of nutrition in the prevention of disease. One of my favorite extracurricular activities on campus
is my involvement with CHANGES, a program that helps students to develop healthy habits through
small group training, nutrient and goal setting workshops. I think everyone has something they want to change and helping someone realize their goal is a great feeling.

### Current Projects
I am Currently working on the BEACH interview study along side Dr. Dominick Lemas along with working on the BEACH study.
