### About

Hey my name is Lauren Wright, I’m a 4th year Pre-Med Health Science major hoping to one day become a Pediatrician. I’ve been assisting Dr. Lemas in his research since August of 2017 and have watched our research grow exponentially. From developing questionnaires and sample kits before the start of our clinical trial, to now coding and analyzing the data we collected, I’ve experienced the scientific method firsthand from start to finish.

 

### Projects

-Interview study: A project that consists of interviewing 40 mothers about research recruitment for longitudinal studies. We are currently in the analysis stage and hope to publish a paper this summer. 
-Poster: I created a poster of our preliminary findings to present at different research conferences throughout the semester.
