### About
 
I'm a second-year Computer Science major at the University of Florida with minors in Bioinformatics and Mathematics. I'm interested in working in the fields of sustainability, botany, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Aside from work, my hobbies include kickboxing, gardening, and playing chess.
